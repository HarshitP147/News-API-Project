# The News API Project

### Greetings!

This is a simple News api project that displays all the major healines in India  

The simple webpage was made for practice to learn about fetch API and how it is incorporated with the HTML elements

The JavaScript dynamically loads all the news cards on pressing a dummy submit button and inside the main section, all the information inside the cards is also placed.

The styling is mostly done using BootStrap CSS.

This is the basic version of project.  
In near future, I will add different queries for news and headlines for different countries and in different languages.

### All suggestions and help from your side will be welcome!!

## Thank you!
